## Hi, I am Laingam Laishram 👋

**Embedded Systems Engineer**

I specialize in designing and developing robust, low-level firmware for resource-constrained microcontrollers. My expertise lies in writing clean C/C++, implementing real-time applications (RTOS), and interfacing directly with hardware.

#### 🛠 My Core Competencies
* **Embedded C/C++ and RTOS:** Building high-performance, multitasking applications (TI-RTOS, FreeRTOS).
* **Low-Level Driver Development:** Interfacing peripherals like I2C, SPI, UART, Timers, and GPIOs from scratch.
* **Low-Power System Design:** Architecting and optimizing firmware for battery-powered IoT devices.
* **Microcontroller Architecture:** Proficient with ARM Cortex-M cores (STM32, TI SimpleLink/Tiva-C).
* **Hardware Debugging:** Using debuggers and logic analyzers to solve complex hardware/software integration issues.
* **Microcontroller-based AI/ML:** (Proven ability to deploy CNNs with minimal footprints).
